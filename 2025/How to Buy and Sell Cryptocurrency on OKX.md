## Part 1: Buying Cryptocurrency on OKX

Buying cryptocurrency involves using fiat currencies like CNY or USD to purchase digital assets such as BTC or USDT.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Confirm Your Order:**  
   After selecting your desired cryptocurrency and order amount, click **Next** to proceed.

2. **Make Payment:**  
   Use your mobile banking app, Alipay, or WeChat to transfer the payment to the seller's account. Enter the provided account details accurately and complete the transfer.

3. **Notify the Seller:**  
   Once the payment is made, click **I Have Transferred, Notify the Seller**. The seller will verify the payment, and the purchased cryptocurrency will be released to your account. You can check your assets under the **Assets** section.

### Things to Note:

- **Verification Requests:** Some sellers may request a screenshot of your bank statement for verification. This helps ensure the safety of both parties' funds, similar to bank requirements for real-name account verification. If not completed, the transaction may not proceed.  
- **Use Your Real-Name Bank Account:** Ensure the payment is made using a KYC-verified account registered in your name.  
- **Transaction Limits:** The quick-buy transaction limit per order ranges from **10 CNY to 1,000,000 CNY**.  
- **Large Payments:** For payments exceeding 50,000 CNY made outside of working hours (17:00â€“08:00), consider splitting the transaction to avoid delays.  
- **Order Cancellation:** You can cancel orders within the allotted time. However, frequent cancellations or exceeding payment deadlines may affect your credit score, limiting your ability to place orders that day.

### Additional Buying Options:

- **C2C Marketplace:**  
  In addition to the quick-buy feature, you can explore the **C2C Buy** section to find suitable offers.  
- **Bulk Transactions:**  
  For transactions exceeding 100,000 CNY, use the filter option to select **Bulk Trades** for better rates and liquidity.

## Part 2: Selling Cryptocurrency on OKX

Selling cryptocurrency on OKX is just as straightforward. Here's how to securely sell your assets to interested buyers.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Wait for Payment:**  
   Once the buyer confirms the transaction, wait for the payment to be made. Check your mobile banking or online banking account for the receipt.

2. **Confirm Receipt:**  
   After verifying the payment has been credited to your account, click **Confirm Receipt** to release the digital assets to the buyer.

### Things to Note:

  If the payment is not received for an extended period, you can click **File a Dispute** to freeze the order and involve OKX customer support.  
- **Verify Payment Before Release:**  
  Always verify that the funds have been credited to your account before releasing the cryptocurrency.

### Additional Selling Options:

- **C2C Marketplace:**  
  You can also sell cryptocurrency in the **C2C Buy** section by choosing a suitable buyer and price.  
- **Bulk Trades:**  
  For transactions above 100,000 CNY, filter for **Bulk Trades** to find the most advantageous deals.
