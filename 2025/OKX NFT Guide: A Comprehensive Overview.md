## What Are NFTs?

- NFTs are typically minted using the ERC-721 standard. They are unique, indivisible, and interoperable proofs of ownership of digital assets. For instance, an NFT could represent your house or equipment in the metaverse, or even verify ownership of digital or physical items, such as art or collectibles.  
- Unlike FT (Fungible Tokens), each NFT has unique attributes, making it distinct from others. These attributes are stored on the blockchain or other distributed networks.

## ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155

### ERC-721

- ERC-721, also known as the Non-Fungible Token Standard, is the smart contract standard used for creating NFTs. According to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal, NFTs can represent ownership of digital or physical assets.

### ERC-1155

- Compared to ERC-721, ERC-1155 provides a unified solution for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While ERC-20 requires a new smart contract for each token type, ERC-721 allows the creation of independent token groups, known as NFTs.  
- ERC-1155, however, introduces a multi-token standard that allows each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, complete with its own metadata, supply, and attributes.
