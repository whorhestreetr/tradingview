# Unveiling NFT Investment Trends: How Top Venture Capitalists Are Strategizing

## Introduction: The Rise of NFTs

After the DeFi Summer of 2020, speculation swirled that NFTs would become the next big trend. However, the NFT market remained lukewarm from October to February of the following year. It wasn't until March, when Christie's auctioned an NFT digital artwork for a staggering $69 million, that NFTs truly went mainstream, attracting widespread media attention. This milestone ushered in a wave of development, but the limited liquidity of digital art led to a cooling period.

By May, the launch of Uniswap V3 introduced NFTs into the DeFi ecosystem through LP tokens, further advancing NFT financialization. Events like the NBA playoffs and the UEFA Champions League Finals sparked interest in sports NFTs. Despite these developments, the broader market's pessimism delayed NFTs' exponential growth.

The turning point came with the rise of GameFi, driven by the Play-to-Earn model's impressive returns and the implementation of EIP-1559. These factors propelled GameFi and collectible NFTs into the spotlight, significantly boosting NFT sales and market capitalization.
