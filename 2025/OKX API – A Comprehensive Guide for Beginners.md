## Key Functionalities

### Fetching Trading Pair Information

Retrieve available trading pairs using the `/market/tickers` endpoint. Example code:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://www.okx.com'
tickers = pd.DataFrame(requests.get(f'{url}/api/v5/market/tickers?instType=SPOT').json()['data'])
tickers.tail().T
```

---

### Retrieving Price Data

Get real-time price data for a specific trading pair:

```python
response = requests.get(f'{url}/api/v5/market/ticker?instId=BTC-USD-SWAP')
print(response.json())
```

---

### Getting Historical Data

Use the `history-candles` endpoint to access historical price data:

```python
data = requests.get(f'{url}/api/v5/market/history-candles?instId=BTC-USDT-SWAP').json()
print(data)
```

---

### Using Technical Indicators

Create custom indicators like the 20-day SMA using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

data['20_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
```

---

book = requests.get(f'{url}/api/v5/market/books?instId=BTC-USD-SWAP&sz=10').json()
print(book['data'])

### Executing Trades Programmatically

order = {
    "instId": "BTC-USDT",
    "side": "buy",
    "ordType": "market",
    "sz": "0.01"
}
response = requests.post(f'{url}/api/v5/trade/order', json=order)
print(response.json())
```

---

### Canceling Orders

Cancel an active order using its order ID:

```python
cancel = {"ordId": "123456"}

print(response.json())
```
