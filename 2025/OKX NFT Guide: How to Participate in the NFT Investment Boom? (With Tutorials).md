## What Are NFTs?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced or exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are issued based on unique standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155. They can represent anything from digital art to game items, collectibles, and more. Recently, NFT-focused blockchains like Flow have also emerged, specializing in the issuance and circulation of NFT assets.

## How to Invest in NFTs: 6 Key Methods

### 1. **Buying NFT Tokens**
For beginners, purchasing NFT-related tokens is the simplest way to enter the NFT market. According to CoinGecko, there are over 100 NFT tokens with a total market cap of nearly $7.6 billion as of March 17. These tokens are not NFTs themselves but governance or utility tokens for NFT projects. Popular options include ENJ and CHZ.

#### How to Buy NFT Tokens:
- **Centralized Exchanges (CEX)**: Platforms like [OKX](https://bit.ly/OKXe) offer NFT tokens with low fees and easy accessibility.
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**: Platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap are ideal for early access to new projects, although they come with challenges like high gas fees and network congestion.

## Risks and Considerations

While the NFT market is booming, it is still in its early stages. Many NFTs have low liquidity, meaning it could take weeks or months to sell them at desired prices. Additionally, the market faces risks of scams and speculative bubbles. It's crucial to thoroughly research and understand the market before making investments.
